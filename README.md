# Spotify Music Data ETL Pipeline Using AWS

## Overview
This project demonstrates a scalable and automated ETL pipeline built to extract, transform, and load music data from Spotify, utilizing a suite of AWS services including Lambda, S3, Glue, Athena, and CloudWatch. Designed for the music industry, this pipeline streamlines data processing, delivering valuable insights through an efficient, serverless architecture.

## Data Flow Overview
The pipeline starts by fetching raw music data from Spotifyâ€™s API, processes it using AWS Lambda for data extraction and transformation, and stores the results in Amazon S3. AWS Glue catalogs the data, while Athena enables querying for analysis.

### 1. Extract (Spotify API via AWS Lambda)
- **Spotify API**: The pipeline begins by pulling data (tracks, artists, albums, etc.) from Spotify using a Python script within an AWS Lambda function.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: CloudWatch triggers this Lambda function daily to ensure timely data updates.

### 2. Load Raw Data (S3 Bucket)
- **Amazon S3 (Raw Data)**: The extracted data is stored securely in an Amazon S3 bucket, providing scalable storage for raw data.
- **Trigger (Object Put)**: When new raw data is uploaded to S3, an event trigger automatically kicks off the next stage of the pipeline.

### 3. Transform (Data Processing via AWS Lambda)
- **AWS Lambda (Transformation)**: A second Lambda function processes the raw data by cleaning, formatting, and aggregating it, preparing it for storage.
- **Amazon S3 (Transformed Data)**: The transformed data is stored separately in another S3 bucket for ease of access and independent management.

### 4. Catalog Data (AWS Glue)
- **AWS Glue Crawler**: AWS Glue automatically scans the transformed data in S3, inferring its schema and creating a catalog that simplifies data discovery.
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: The catalog metadata is stored centrally, making querying and analytics easier.

### 5. Analyze Data (Amazon Athena)
- **Amazon Athena**: Using Athena, you can run SQL queries directly on the data stored in S3, allowing real-time analysis and insights.

## Key Benefits
- **Fully Automated Workflow**: Using CloudWatch, Lambda, and S3 event triggers, the pipeline runs automatically with daily updates, requiring minimal manual oversight.
- **Scalable and Secure Storage**: Amazon S3 ensures seamless scalability for storing both raw and processed data, making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Serverless and Cost-Efficient Processing**: AWS Lambda handles both extraction and transformation, keeping the architecture serverless and reducing infrastructure costs.
- **Automated Data Discovery**: AWS Glue simplifies metadata management by automatically cataloging data, making it easy to access and analyze.
- **Real-Time Insights**: With Athena, users can instantly query the data for actionable insights, improving decision-making in the music industry.

## Conclusion
This project, completed as part of the Python for Data Engineering course by Data Vidya, showcases how AWS services can be effectively combined to build a robust, automated ETL pipeline. This pipeline allows for real-time analysis of music data, providing invaluable insights to stakeholders in the music industry.
